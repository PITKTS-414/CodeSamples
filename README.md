# CodeSamples

Some code samples of mine! 

I have the following school projects available upon request (code cannot be put into a public repo):
- 'WonkyKong' (A spin off of Nintendo's famous game. Object-Oriented progamming. A larger program with many header and source files.) [CS 32, C++]
- 'FlightSegments' (A program that utilizes the A* algorithm to find the optimal choices of flights, given a predetermined database. Includes an implementation of a BST.) [CS 32, C++]
- 'Bees!' (A mini game you play on your Terminal / Command Line to pass some time. Utilizes dynamic memory.) [CS 31, C++]
